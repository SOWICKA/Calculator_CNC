The CNC Calculator helps calculate the necessary cutting parameters for drilling, turning, planning, and milling. 
Auxiliary tables of preliminary data needed for calculations contain suggested data for atypical materials. 
You can find standard data in guides or consult the manufacturer's data for your cutting tools. 
As the CALCULATOR is available in 3 language variants, RUN START.py to initiate language selection, or directly launch by selecting the file containing the preferred language abbreviation in its name, EN, DE, PL.

TEST.py 
Since the original script is not structured in a way that easily allows for unit testing without significant refactoring,
this mock-up will simulate the process of testing a simplified version of the calculation logic.
This example will focus on the milling operation calculation logic, extracted and simplified for demonstration.
